## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React Native)
- React Navigation for screen navigation
- Redux/Context API for state management
- React Native Video for video playback
- React Native Elements/UI Kitten for consistent UI components
- Axios for API requests
- AsyncStorage for local storage
- React Native Push Notification for notifications

### Backend Services
- Authentication service (Firebase Auth or custom)
- Content management system (CMS)
- Recommendation engine
- Analytics service
- Notification service
- Payment processing service

### Content Delivery
- Content hosting and CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection

### Database Schema
- Users collection (profiles, preferences, viewing history)
- Content collection (movies, series, episodes, metadata)
- Categories collection (genres, tags)
- Subscriptions collection (plans, user subscriptions)
- Payments collection (transactions, billing history)

## Payment Gateway Integration
- Integration with private payment gateway
- Secure transaction processing
- Subscription management
- Recurring billing

## Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Authentication, basic content browsing, and playback
2. **Phase 2**: User profiles, recommendations, and offline viewing
3. **Phase 3**: Payment integration and subscription management
4. **Phase 4**: Admin panel and content management
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (multiple profiles, enhanced recommendations)

## Technical Requirements
