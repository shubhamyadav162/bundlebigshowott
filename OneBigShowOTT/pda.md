To build BigShow as a modern, cross-platform React Native OTT app on Expo SDK 52, it’s essential to align all dependencies with the New Architecture, leverage Expo’s managed workflow for rapid development and device testing, and follow proven UI/UX patterns for streaming services. By using expo-doctor to detect incompatible libraries, adhering strictly to SDK 52’s supported modules, and employing best practices like carousel-driven home screens and bottom navigation, you’ll ensure both technical stability and a premium user experience on Android and iOS devices.

1. Ensuring Expo SDK 52 Compatibility
Adopt the New Architecture by Default: Expo SDK 52 ships with the New Architecture enabled, so all apps created with
npx create-expo-app --template blank will use it out of the box 
Expo
.

Validate Third-Party Libraries: Run npx expo-doctor@latest to scan for native module incompatibilities against React Native Directory. Replace or upgrade any libraries flagged as incompatible with the New Architecture 
Expo
.

Follow Upgrade Walkthroughs: If migrating from SDK 49, delete existing android/ios folders in a managed project and re-prebuild with npx expo prebuild. Then run npx pod-install to align iOS pods with React Native 0.77

Avoid Expo Go Version Mismatch: Do not update the Expo Go app on your device beyond the version compatible with SDK 52—if Expo Go upgrades to SDK 53 only, it will break loading of your SDK 52 project. Instead, use a custom development build for testing on physical devices

2. React Native Project Setup
Managed Workflow with Expo:

Start with Expo’s managed workflow to avoid native code conflicts.

Use Cursor AI to scaffold components, modules, and screens, ensuring consistent code style.

Dependency Alignment:

Replace deprecated APIs (e.g. expo-av → expo-video) as recommended in SDK 52 release notes 
Expo
.

Ensure all SDK packages (camera, notifications, database) are at versions supported by Expo 52.

Testing on Android:

Generate a development build (eas build --profile development) and install the .apk on your Android device for live reloading and debugging

3. UI/UX Design for a Modern OTT Experience
3.1 Layout & Navigation
Home Carousel: Showcase featured web series in a full-width, swipeable carousel on the home screen, using optimized images for FastList performance 
HashStudioz
.

Bottom Tab Bar: Implement a persistent bottom navigation bar (Home, Categories, Search, Profile) for easy access—leveraging React Navigation v7 under the hood 
TechAhead
.

Category Rows: Below the main carousel, display horizontal scroll rows (“Trending,” “New Releases,” “Recommended”) implemented via FlatList with getItemLayout for smooth rendering

3.2 Visual Styling
Modern Aesthetic: Use a dark theme with high-contrast text and vibrant accent colors for play buttons and badges, reflecting premium OTT platforms like Netflix and Disney+

Adaptive Layouts: Employ Flexbox and percentage-based widths so the UI scales gracefully across various screen sizes and aspect ratios

.

Smooth Animations: Integrate subtle motion (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins) using React Native’s Animated API or Reanimated to enhance perceived performance

3.3 Performance Optimization
Image Caching: Use expo-image or React Native’s Image component with caching strategies to minimize network requests and improve scroll fluidity

.

Code Splitting & Lazy Loading: Dynamically import screens and heavy components (e.g., the video player) to reduce initial bundle size and launch time

4. Avoiding Dependency Conflicts
Single Expo SDK Target: By committing to Expo 52 and React Native 0.77, you eliminate mismatches like those between Expo 49 and SDK 52 
Expo Documentation
.

Regular Audits: Periodically run expo-doctor and review changelogs to ensure that new libraries remain compatible with your SDK target 
Expo
.

Use Managed Plugins: For native features (e.g., video playback, analytics), prefer Expo-supported plugins over community forks to minimize breakage

5. Delivering on Android Devices
Development Builds for Expo Go: Create custom dev builds so that your physical Android device always runs a version of Expo Go that matches SDK 52, avoiding “SDK mismatch” errors
